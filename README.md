Pedestrian Safety System using Arduino

This project is a basic Arduino-based pedestrian safety prototype developed to detect nearby objects and provide a safety indication. The system uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance of objects in front of it. When an object comes within a distance of 20 cm, the Arduino processes the input and activates a servo motor to indicate a safety response.

The distance measured by the ultrasonic sensor is continuously displayed on the Serial Monitor, which helps in testing and observing the system behavior in real time. The project focuses on understanding sensor interfacing, distance calculation, and basic actuator control using Arduino.

This prototype can be used as a learning model for pedestrian alert systems and smart traffic safety applications. It is suitable for beginners who want hands-on experience with Arduino, sensors, and servo motors.

Components used in this project include Arduino UNO, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and jumper wires. The ultrasonic sensor is connected to digital pins 9 and 10 for trigger and echo, while the servo motor signal pin is connected to digital pin 6.
