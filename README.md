# Pedestrian_Safety_Automation
Pedestrian Safety System using Arduino is a simple hardware prototype that detects nearby objects using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. When an object is detected within 20 cm, the Arduino UNO triggers a servo motor as a safety indication. The measured distance is continuously displayed on the Serial Monitor for monitoring.
